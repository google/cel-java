# Publishes CEL to a Maven repository.
#
# To push locally, just run the script. On MacOS by default, the artifact lives in ~/.m2/repository
# To publish a SNAPSHOT version, run with -snapshot (-s) flag: "publish.sh --snapshot". Snapshots can be found in https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/#nexus-search;quick~dev.cel
# To publish a RELEASE version remotely, run with -release (-r) flag: "publish.sh --release". Note that released maven artifacts are permanent and can never be deleted under any circumstances.

# Note, to publish remotely:
# 1. You must create a pgp certificate and upload it to keyserver.ubuntu.com. See https://blog.sonatype.com/2010/01/how-to-generate-pgp-signatures-with-maven/
# 2. You will need to enter the key's password. The prompt appears in GUI, not in terminal. The publish operation will eventually timeout if the password is not entered.
